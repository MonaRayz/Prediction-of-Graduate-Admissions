# Prediction-of-Graduate-Admissions
This machine learning project aims to predict the Chance of Admit for Graduate programs based on several key parameters that influence admissions in Indian universities. The project uses a Decision Tree Classifier and Decision Tree Regressor to predict whether an applicant will be admitted to a graduate program, with the target variable being the Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1).
